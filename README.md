# autoSuggestList
jQuery plugin to attach an auto suggest dropdown list to a text box
Requires jQuery 1.12.4 and jQuery UI 1.10 (or any newer versions).

Every setting can be changed at any time without reinitialization.
Your suggest list can hold objects with several properties.
The object itself is accessible in event handlers and custom callbacks, not just certain properties.
Dynamic and especially useful if you're changing its behavior options in response to other events
Styles are very easy to change via options.
